# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
We made the robot go through an obstacle course and coded how we were gonna make it traverse throught the course. We did it very basically just moving foirward and turning right or left while making it back up into the finish point.
## Challenges faced and solutions
The biggest challenge was setting up all the things to actually be able to setup the robot especially the video studio code whioch took a long time to setup. Another problem we faced was that on one of the longest stretched the robot kept viering off even thought it was supposed to move forward to fix that we had it move a little more than 90 degrees and it worked 
## Future enhancements
Some future enhancements I would add is making the robot do other features such as make music and have lights flashing because we just did it very basic and I think it could be a little more creative
